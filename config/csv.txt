The number of active participant-weeks are the number of participants
who were active for the whole week, where participants who were only
active during a part of the week are counted as a fraction. A participant
is only included if it has completed at least 3 symptoms' questionnaires,
and is active between the day of its first completed symptoms' survey
until the last completed symptoms' survey. Any symptoms a participant had
when registering are ignored.

Based on the reported symptoms, the number of ILI onsets for each week
(Monday-Sunday) is determined based on four different ILI case definitions:
