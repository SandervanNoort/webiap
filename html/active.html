<h2 id="active">Active participants</h2>

<p>
People who are experiencing ILI symptoms are more inclined to register
in Influenzanet. This is especially the case when many new persons
join during the initial phase of a new influenza epidemic, due to
media attention. Therefore, the first survey of every participant,
in which a participant reports symptoms he/she had in the week(s) 
before joining, is ignored (<i>ignore_first = True</i>).
The first day a participant is considered active is therefore
defined as the day following his/her first completed survey.
</p>

<p>
A participant is considered active until the day of his/her last completed 
symptoms questionnaire (<i>always_active = False</i>). 
Although it is possible that participants who stop reporting do so because 
they do not have any symptoms, we do not have any information about this.
</p>

<p>
Participants are encouraged by a weekly email reminder to complete their
symptoms' questionnaire every week, whether they have any (ILI) symptoms
or not. This allows the calculation of a reliable incidence,
based on the ratio of participants with and without symptoms.
Participants who do not report regularly are excluded from the analyses,
defined as participants who have completed less than 3 symptoms' 
questionnaires (<i>min_surveys = 3</i>), as well as participants who
report on average less than every 3 weeks (<i>max_freq = 21</i>).
