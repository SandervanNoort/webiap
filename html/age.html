<h2 id="age_correction">Age correction</h2>

<p>
It is possible to do age correction on the determined (ILI) activity.
The corrected (ILI) activity in the population is determined by:
</p>

<p class='math'>
(ILI) activity = 
    Sum( fraction(age_group) * activity(age_group) )
</p>

<p>
where the fraction each age group represents in the population is
take from Eurostat. The default age distribution is: 1-14, 15-64, and 65-100 
(<i>age_correction = 1-15-65-100</i>).
</p>

<p>
Age correction is util to compensate for underrepresented groups.
However, in Influenzanet the underrepresented groups could be so small,
that within such a group there is no clear (ILI) signal.
By doing age correction, these underrepresented noisy signals get 
amplified, leading to a more noisy signal in the age corrected ILI activity.
Therefore, by default no age correction is applied.
