<h2 id="casedef">ILI case definitions</h2>

<p>
The following case definition for influenza-like
illness is recommended by the 
<a href="http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/activities/surveillance/EISN/surveillance/Pages/influenza_case_definitions.aspx">ECDC</a>.
From season 2011-2012 on, all countries participating in Influenzanet
will use the same questionnaire and will apply this case definition.
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup></strong> - ECDC recommendation
<ul>
    <li>Sudden onset of symptoms</li>
    <li>At least 1 of: Fever or feverishness (chills); Malaise; Headache; Muscle pain</li>
    <li>At least 1 of: Cough; Sore throat; Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p style='clear: both'>
Many national surveillance systems do not apply the ECDC recommendation,
but rather apply an ILI case definition which requires fever, especially
to distinguish between a real influenza infection and a common cold. 
We therefore introduce a variation of the ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup> 
definition which does require fever:
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>fever</i></sup></strong> - Requiring fever
<ul>
    <li>Sudden onset of symptoms</li>
    <li>Fever or feverishness (chills)</li>
    <li>At least 1 of: Malaise; Headache; muscle pain</li>
    <li>At least 1 of: Cough; Sore throat; Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p style='clear: both'>
The ILI case definition in use by the 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm">CDC</a> is defined by:
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>cdc</i></sup></strong> - CDC recommendation
<ul>
    <li>Fever (at least 37.8 degrees Celsius)</li>
    <li>At least 1 of: cough or sore throat</li>
    <li>Without a known cause other than influenza</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p style='clear: both'>
During the first seasons of Influenzanet, participants could only report
a fever if they measured their temperature, and not all symptoms were
reported. Therefore, the
ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup>, ILI<sup><i>fever</i></sup> and
ILI<sup><i>cdc</i></sup>definitions cannot be applied.
We introduce the following case definition, based on the
ILI<sup><i>fever</i></sup> definition:
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>hist</i></sup></strong> - All (historic) seasons
<ul>
    <li>Measured temperature &ge; 38 degrees Celsius</li>
    <li>Sudden onset of symptoms or fever</li>
    <li>At least 1 of: Headache; Muscle pain</li>
    <li>At least 1 of: Cough; Sore throat</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p style='clear: both'>
The ILI<sup><i>hist</i></sup> can be equally applied to all countries
and seasons. However, care should still be taken when comparing different
countries. Due to cultural
 differences, participants could have different customs whether to
actually measure their temperature in case of a (suspected) fever.
</p>

<p style='clear: both'>
Within the Influenzanet system, multiple ILI case definitions can be
used simultaneously. ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup> has a higher sensitivity,
since more participants with influenza will fit the definition.
ILI<sup><i>hist</i></sup> has a higher specificity, since fewer 
participants who do not have influenza, will fit the definition.
See for example: 
<a href='?page=results&casedef=compare&country=nl&season=2011&type=selfdiag_venn__s800_1&group=selfdiag'>The Netherlands 2011/12</a>.
</p>

<p>
Influenzanet can monitor more syndrome or diseases based on the reported
symptoms.

<strong>Allergy</strong> Allergy / Hay fever
<ul>
    <li>Not ILI<sup>ecdc</sup></li>
    <li>Not fever or chills or Temperature &ge;38C</li>
    <li>At least 1 of: Runny or blocked nose; sneezing; watery, bloodshot eyes</li>
    <li>Participant suspects symptoms due to allergy</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Not ILI<sup>ecdc</sup></li>
    <li>At least 2 of: diarrhoea; nausea; vomiting; stomach ache</li>
