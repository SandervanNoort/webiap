<h2 id="casedef">ILI case definitions</h2>

<p>
The following case definition for influenza-like
illness is recommended by the 
<a href="http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/activities/surveillance/EISN/surveillance/Pages/influenza_case_definitions.aspx">ECDC</a>:
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup></strong> - ECDC recommendation
<ul>
    <li>Sudden onset of symptoms</li>
    <li>Fever or feverishness (chills) or Malaise or Headache or Myalgia (muscle pain))</li>
    <li>Cough or Sore throat or Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p style='clear: both'>
From season 2011-2012 on, all countries participating in Influenanet
will use the same questionnaire and will apply this case definition.
Many national surveillance systems do not apply the ECDC recommendation,
but rather apply an ILI case definition which requires fever, especially
to distinguish between a real influenza infection and a common cold. 
We therefore introduce a variation of the ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup> 
definition which does require fever:
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>fever</i></sup></strong> - Requiring fever
<ul>
    <li>Sudden onset of symptoms</li>
    <li>Fever or feverishness (chills)</li>
    <li>Malaise or Headache or Myalgia (muscle pain))</li>
    <li>Cough or Sore throat or Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p style='clear: both'>
Within the Influenzanet system, multiple ILI case definitions can be
used simultaneously. ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup> has a higher sensitivity,
since more participants with influenza will fit the definition.
ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup> has a higher specificity, since fewer 
participants who do not have influenza, will fit the definition.
</p>

<p style='clear: both'>
For historic seasons, both ILI<sup><i>ecdc</i></sup> and 
ILI<sup><i>fever</i></sup> definitions cannot be applied.
First, malaise and shortness of breath were mostly not reported in the
first seasons of influenzanet. 
More importantly, until 2010 participants did not report the sudden onset 
of symptoms, but only the sudden onset of the fever if they had a
measured temperature over 38 degrees Celsius. Therefore, we introduce
the following case definition:
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>hist</i></sup></strong> - Seasons before 2010
<ul>
    <li>Measured temperature &ge; 38 degrees Celsius</li>
    <li>(Sudden onset of symptoms) or (Sudden onset of fever)</li>
    <li>(Headache) or (Myalgia)</li>
    <li>(Cough) or (Sore throat)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p style='clear: both'>
The ILI<sup><i>hist</i></sup> can be equally applied to most countries
and seasons. However, due to cultural differences between countries
participants could have different customs when to measure their 
temperature in case of a (suspected) fever, or could estimate their
temperature.
</p>

<!--
<p>
In every country and season, the participant was informed about the
sudden onset if they reported a temperature of at least 38 degrees. We
therefore introduce the following ILI case definition:
</p>

Only if they reported fever, they were also informed about the sudden
onset of the fever. 

the sudden onset of disease is an essential element
of influenza-like illness. However,

During different seasons and countries, the question 
about the sudden
onset of fever was presented when the participants had a measured 
temperature above 38 degrees Celsius ("38C"), 
and/or had cold shivers ("shivers"),
and/or had a non-measured fever ("fever").

The following table lists for every country and season, which minimal 
symptoms a participant had to report, before he/she could report a 
sudden onset.

<p>
By requiring fever (measured, non-measured or shivers), the 
ILI<sup><i>e</i></sup> case definition is transformed
to:
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>f</i></sup></strong> - Fever required
<ul>
    <li>(Fever) or (Cold shivers) or (Measured temperature &ge; 38 degrees Celsius)</li>
    <li>(Sudden onset of symptoms) or (Sudden onset of fever)</li>
    <li>(Headache) or (Myalgia)</li>
    <li>(Cough) or (Sore throat)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Previous scientific publications on Influenzanet data, usually
required myalgia (muscle pain) as an essential element in the
case definition:
</p>

<div class="casedef">
<strong>ILI<sup><i>m</i></sup></strong> - Myalgia 
    and temperature &ge;38 Celsius required
<ul>
    <li>Measured temperature &ge; 38 degrees Celsius</li>
    <li>(Sudden onset of symptoms) or (Sudden onset of fever)</li>
    <li>(Myalgia)</li>
    <li>(Cough) or (Sore throat)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p style='clear: both'>
This case definition seem to give the most consistent results in
comparison with the ILI incidence as measured by medical doctors.
