<h2 id="activity">ILI activity</h2>

<p>
The (ILI) activity for a certain week (Monday-Sunday) is defined
as the number of onsets divided by the number of participant-weeks.
</p>
<p class='math'>
    Activity = Onsets / Person-weeks
</p>
<p>
A participant who has been active during the full week is counted
as 1 person-week. A participant who
either registered during the week, or who completed his/her last
symptoms' questionnaire during the week, is counted as a fraction.
</p>
<p>
For determining the day of onset, we use the fever onset data if 
provided, else the symptoms onset date if provided, and finally 
the reporting data if neither the symptoms nor the fever onset date is 
provided (<i>onset = "fever"</i>).
</p>

<p>
Onsets which occurred before a person registered in Influenzanet and
which are reported in the first survey, are ignored 
(<i>ignore_first = True</i>).
For a participant who fits the case definition during two consecutive
surveys, only the first onset is considered (<i>ignore_doube = True</i>).
Note that if both the first survey and consecutive surveys are excluded,
the onset of a participant who fits the case definition in both his/her first 
and second survey, is also excluded.
