<h3>Influenzanet</h3>
<p>
Influenzanet is a system to monitor the activity of
influenza-like-illness (ILI) with the aid of volunteers via the
internet. It has been operational in The Netherlands and Belgium
(since 2003), Portugal (since 2005), Italy (since 2008) and United
Kingdom (since 2009), and the current objective is to implement 
Influenzanet in more European countries. 
In contrast with the traditional system of sentinel
networks of mainly primary care physicians, Influenzanet obtains its
data directly from the population. This creates a fast and flexible
monitoring system whose uniformity allows for direct comparison of
ILI rates between countries.

<p>
Any resident of a country where Influenzanet is implemented can
participate by completing an online application form, which contains
various medical, geographic and behavioural questions. Participants
are reminded weekly to report any symptoms they have experienced
since their last visit. The ILI activity is determined on the
basis of a uniform case definition.
