For plotting the (ILI) activity, the weekly activity (Monday-Sunday) is
plotted on Sundays. The determined weekly activity can either be
joined by straight lines (<i>daily=False</i>), or the
weekly activity can be determined for each day, where for example on
Fridays the weekly activity for the period Saturday-Friday is plotted
(<i>daily=True</i>)
</p>

<p>
For graphs which compare various subgroups, these subgroups can be so 
small, which leads to very noisy incidences.
Therefore, the incidences in those graphs are a moving average over 
three weeks.

When comparing the ILI activity determined by Influenzanet with the
ILI activity determined by the medical doctors reporting to the
ECDC, the absolute values could differ significantly.
These differences could be attributed to the different case definitions
used by medical doctors in different countries, as well as the different
rate at which people with ILI symptoms visit their doctor. Also, there
could be a selection bias in the people who decide to participate in 
Influenzanet, as well as a selection bias in people who decide to visit
a GP. The trends in ILI activity as measured by both systems are however
similar, which can be illustrated by plotting ILI activity from both
system in the same diagram on different scales. To determine the scaling
between the axes of both system, a linear regression between the ILI
activity of both systems is done, and the "gradient" and "intercept"
are defined, such that:
</p>

<p class='math'>
    ILI (Influenzanet) = "gradient" * ILI (EISN) + "intercept"
</p>

<p>
The coefficients are based on the data for all previous seasons combined
(<i>linreg_seasons = "2003,...,2010"</i>). 
We fix the intercept at 0 (<i>plot.linreg_intercept0 = True</i>), such
that Influenzanet=0 always corresponds to EISN=0. 
Leaving the intercept free, in general shows that
Influenzanet has a relatively higher baseline than EISN. However,
plots where the origins of the Influenzanet and EISN axes are not
aligned, such that an ILI activity of zero in Influenzanet corresponds to a
negative ILI incidence in EISN, leads to confusing graphs.
